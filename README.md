# Cancer Among Young Adult Analysis

Contirbutor: Xinzhu Wang, Jin Ying

In this project, we do analysis about cancer sites on different year(2010-2015), age group(20-24 and 25-29), sex(Female and Male) and races(Asian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, Other Races and Unknown combined, and White). There is a html file showing our project result and a shiny app which will give readers a more vivid experience.
